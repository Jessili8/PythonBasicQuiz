Question 1: How do you import the math module in Python?
Your answer: import math
Correct!
GPT says: Great job! You've demonstrated your understanding of Python by knowing that you can import the math module using the line `import math`. This is an important step for leveraging the various mathematical functions and constants that the module offers. Keep up the fantastic work, and keep exploring all the great features Python has to offer! üåüFun fact: In Python, to import the math module, you simply use the statement `import math`. This allows you to access a variety of mathematical functions and constants, such as `math.pi` for the value of œÄ (pi) and `math.sqrt()` for square root. The math module is part of Python's standard library, which means you don't need to install anything extra to use it‚Äîjust import and calculate!

Question 2: What function do you use to display output in Python?
Your answer: print
Incorrect. The correct answer was: print()
GPT says: A fun hint related to displaying output in Python: Think about something you would want to "print" to the world, not just keep hidden away. The keyword is also used when creating a document that you want to produce physically!

Question 3: Which symbol is used to comment a single line in Python?
Your answer: #
Correct!
GPT says: Great job! The symbol used to comment a single line in Python is the hashtag (#). Comments are a fantastic way to add clarity and explanations to your code, making it easier to understand for both yourself and others. Keep up the great work in mastering Python!A fun fact related to your question is that in Python, the symbol used for single-line comments is the hash or pound sign (`#`). Interestingly, the use of the `#` symbol for comments in programming languages has its roots in the early days of computing. It was adopted in various programming languages due to its simplicity and ease of use. Did you know that in some other languages, comments can be denoted with different symbols? For example, in C and C++, a double forward slash (`//`) is used for single-line comments!

Quiz Completed! Your final score is: 2/3
